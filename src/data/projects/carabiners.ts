  about: [
    "I led the design of a new line of carabiners at a new manufacturing partner. Black Diamond was winding down in-house carabiner production, and I was responsible for launching an all-new product line at a factory we hadn’t used before. I owned the mechanical design for every carabiner, including 3D models and drawing sets, while coordinating closely with the factory, industrial design, and project management to keep requirements aligned and decisions moving. The best part was the cross-functional collaboration, which helped deliver five carabiner projects early and under budget and established a strong foundation for future work at the factory. Key contributors included Jake Hall (industrial design), Mary Kate (project management), and the team at CIC for executing production. I am extremely grateful to have been able to work with this team.",

    title: "A special note on carabiner design:",
    body: "Carabiners are a unique product to design because they are PPE with certification and safety requirements, they are also very cheap (FOB costs need to be a few dollars), and they are extremely weight constrained. They appear easy to design at first glance, but very small surface tweaks can be the difference between garbage and a long lasting product that I'm happy to trust my life with. In summary, I think a mediocre carabiner is easy to design (I've made a few), but a weight constrained, fit for production, durable, good looking carabiner that people actually want to buy is a special challenge in nuance.",
